I told him
I told him some things never last forever
Sometimes they do but not forever
And now I see for real
I think I really do
But never for forever
As I can see the world around me
I feel it deep within my bones
I feel it here within my soul
My poor lost soul
It makes me so hysterical
The way things go
But if forever last still now
Alright
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Up in the morning light
The break of dawn
A never ending memory
Rays of the sun flow down
Like always
If you could change the world
Would you make all the things
That stay here for forever
That might just be the way I'm feeling
I feel it deep deep in my bones
I feel it shake throughout my soul
This poor lost soul
It makes me so hysterical
The way things go
But if forever last still now
Alright
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
And if forever lasts till now
Alright
